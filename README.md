# Software-Engineering

### This is course work done for CS346: Software Engineering Lab, Jan-Apr 2021, IIT Guwahati.

Project assigned for the lab was deal finder application. The project description is as follows:

Online shopping makes the shopping process easy. But it often happens that you buy something from an eCommerce site and later you realize it could
have been much cheaper in another eCommerce site. Sometimes these eCommerce platforms such as Flipkart, amazon show different prices for the same product. 
To not be a fool next time, you can do extensive search on
your product prices and also search for valid coupon codes. Doing this can save lots of money in the end. In this project, you have to develop a software solution that can help a shopper find the best deals
while buying a product from the eCommerce website.

In this course we used User-Centric Design Approach and performed various stages of Development Cycle. 



Software Design Life Cycle can be diagrammatically expressed in the following way:

General introduction to design patterns can be found here - [Introduction to Design Patterns](https://github.com/ask7276/Software-Engineering/blob/master/Software%20Development%20Life%20Cycle/Introduction%20to%20Design%20Patterns.pdf)

Various Stages Performed are as follows:

* [Software Requirement Specification - Purpose, Functional Requirements and Non-Functional Requirements](https://github.com/ask7276/Software-Engineering/blob/master/Software%20Development%20Life%20Cycle/Software%20Requirements%20Specification%20(SRS).pdf)
* [Design, Design Justification and Usability Document](https://github.com/ask7276/Software-Engineering/blob/master/Software%20Development%20Life%20Cycle/Design%2C%20Design%20Justification%20and%20Usability%20Document.pdf)
* [Medium Fidelity Prototype](https://github.com/ask7276/Software-Engineering/blob/master/Software%20Development%20Life%20Cycle/Prototype.pdf)
* [Early Evaluation (Prototype Evaluation)](https://github.com/ask7276/Software-Engineering/blob/master/Software%20Development%20Life%20Cycle/Early%20Evaluation.pdf)
